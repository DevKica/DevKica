      Hello everyone 💻
</h2>

---

🏫 My name is **Paweł** and I currently study **cybersecurity** at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.

👨‍💻 However, I spend most of my time working as Node.js backend developer.

⌨️ As I said, I specialize in the **backend (Node.js with typescript), security and databases** area. I mainly was using express, currently I've switched to [**Nest**](https://nestjs.com/).

📇 The two main databases I use depending on my needs are **PostgreSQL with prisma** and **MongoDB with mongoose**.

🖱️ When it comes to **frontend** technologies, I mostly use **plain React** (also in **Typescript**), but in the future I will definitely take a closer look at **Next.js**.

<!-- 
📱  One of my main projects was an app to calculate remunerations for employees of the restaurant where I was working: [nstaff](https://github.com/DevKica/nstaff-client)

😊 Currently I work on "unicorn", I haven't come up with a name yet: [unicorn](https://github.com/DevKica/unicorn)
