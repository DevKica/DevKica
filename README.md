      Hello everyone 💻
</h2>

---

🏫 My name is **Paweł** and I currently study **cybersecurity** at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.

👨‍💻 However, I spend most of my time developing **full stack web applications**.

⌨️ I love programming application logic in the **backend area** and designing **highly scalable database architectures**. In most of my projects I used **Node.js** with **Express** and **Typescript**. I have never came across any limitations caused by using these technologies. **For now** they are completely sufficient for my projects, although **I am open to learn about new frameworks and technologies**.

🖱️ When it comes to **frontend** technologies, I mostly use **plain React** (also in **Typescript**), but in the future I will definitely take a closer look at **Next.js**.

📇 The two main databases I use depending on my needs are **PostgreSQL with prisma** and **MongoDB with mongoose**.

🛫 In the **future**, I would like to expand my knowledge with tools such as **Docker** and **Amazon Web Services**.
